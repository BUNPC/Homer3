function EditStimExample(dataSetDir)

%
%   Syntax:
%       EditStimExample(dataSetDir)
%
%   Description:
%       This script shows how to export and edit stim and conditions. This script does the following:
%
%       1. If starting from scratch, first download the DataTree repo from
%          github
%
%           a) git clone  -b <branch_name>   https://github.com/<username>/DataTree  <local_path>/DataTree  
%           b) cd <local_path>/DataTree
%           c) setpaths
%
%       2. Change folder to dataSetDir
%       3. Load data set
%       4. Plot raw data with stim for current element 
%       5. Export stim for current element if the events TSV file does not
%          exist
%       6. Re-plot raw data with stim for current element showing edited stim
%          and conditions
%
%   Examples:
%       cd <local_path>/DataTree
%       EditStimExample('./Examples/SubjDataSample')
%

if ~exist('dataSetDir','var')
    f = which('EditStimExample');
    dataSetDir = [fileparts(f), '/SubjDataSample']; 
end


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% a) Change current folder to a data set folder, 
% b) Load dataset
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
if ~exist(dataSetDir,'dir')
    mkdir(dataSetDir);
end
cd(dataSetDir) 
if exist([dataSetDir, '/derivatives']','dir')
    rmdir([dataSetDir, '/derivatives'], 's')
end

% This step is NOT essential, but is a good idea in order to
% set up logging and load config settings, something that 
% would normally be done by the parent GUI. Since we are 
% running data tree standalone initilize logger an config 
% settings here instead of through parent gui like Homer3
