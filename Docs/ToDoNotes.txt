
Issues to think about and address in the future:


Jan 31, 2019:

-- Minor mistakes and tough to notice errors in the user function help can mean it's not loaded and parsed properly in the registry. Need to fix this. Maybe add a tool where you enter {function name, input names, output names, parameter names} and it generates help text in the hmr*.m file. 

-- Add default traversal behavior for files in the Homer3 listbox so that user doesn't have to contantly click on the group, run, subj radiobuttons - include in this default behavior for datatype radiobuttons buttons. 

-- Add ability to fix x and y ranges in the homer3 data display. 

-- Rework stimGUI change name to StimEditGUI, get rid of associated class and add it to the ChildGuiClass object hmr.childguis. Do same for PlotProbeGUI and ProcStreamOptionsGUI. These all should just be 
front-end client applications of DataTreeClass and FuncRegClass obects. 

-- Revisit the idea of making a uniform sizes condition sets between Subj, Group and Run to allow getting rid of the need for CondNames2* tables. It would really, really simplify things with conditions and make the group and subject level proc stream averaging much easier. 

-- Fix the procStream fixing code that doesn't work. Also really need to simplify it and make it part of a class. 

-- Improve performance of various components of Homer3 
a) starting with the facts that it keeps all the data in memory and doesn't need to 
b) variable preallocation in for loops 
c) ProcStreamEditGUI takes a long time to start and it's responce time is slow.
