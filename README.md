# Homer3
Homer3 is a open source MATLAB application used for analyzing fNIRS data to obtain estimates and maps of brain activation. It is a continuation of the work on the well-established HOMER2 software which itself evolved since the early 1990s, first as the Photon Migration Imaging Toolbox, then as HOMER.

Homer3 is developed and maintained by the [Boston University Neurophotonics Center](http://www.bu.edu/neurophotonics/).
